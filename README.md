# Data Structure with Java

There's an issue with adding a node in between the linkedlist. It gets added but dosen't shows up while calling the show method

## Function Descreiption

1. main(String[] args) ----------------> To run the program
2. insert(int data) -------------------> To add data to the end of the LinkedList
3. insertAt(int index, int data) ------> To recieve the index and place the data at that particular location
4. show()------------------------------> To traverse the LinkedList


## There's problem with insertAt()
