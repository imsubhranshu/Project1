
Sub: Request to debug the code

Respected Sir,
			I tried to implement LinkedList concept in Java. Everything works fine with the code.
			I tried debugging the code and everything seemed fine.
			The only issue I faced was I was not able to insert a node at any desired location.
			I also printed out the object references while debugging and everything seemed fine
			but while traversing, the newly inserted node at desired location was not found within the LinkedList.
			
			Details of the program is given below.
			
			I request if you could go through the code and correct it if I were missing something, I would be much grateful to you
			
			
			Yours Sincerely,
			
			Subhransu sekhar Behera
